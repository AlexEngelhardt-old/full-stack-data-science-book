# Full Stack Data Science

This is a work-in-progress book about the mythical Full Stack Data Scientist,
and the tools, skills and topics that are important for a generalist in this
field.

It will be freely available online as a GitBook, but also be published as an eBook and a print version.

The focus are skills that are not pure machine learning but that you also need to deliver a full data product, for example building the software infrastructure, or making your final model public via an API.

## Goal of this book

- It teaches at least awareness of all topics that are not the core ML skills you already learn at uni or in a MOOC
- This book's goal is not to make you an expert in any of them, but to give you a birds-eye view of the whole landscape
    - Because if you don't know that screwdrivers exist, you'll use your hammer to drive in a screw
    - And if you know these topics exist, you can choose the appropriate tool for the job (even if you'll first have to learn it)
- Also, knowing about e.g. the DevOps part, even if you won't use it in your job, you will know common pitfalls and problems and will build better products to hand over to the operations team (i.e. your model will be easier for them to put into production)

## Target audience

This book is aimed at

- The data science graduate (university or MOOC) who has some experience in     building prediction models and wants to choose the most fitting field to specialize in.
- The expert in a particular field who wants to broaden his view and see how his skills fit into the bigger picture
- The consultant who needs to become a generalist to quickly adapt to each new client's existing environment
- The solo entrepreneur or startup founder who has no other choice than to    build the entire data product himself
- The IT executive who oversees the full pipeline from infrastructure to final    data products and who needs a broad awareness of all topics across the data value chain to make informed decisions

## Feedback

I am happy for all kinds of feedback I can get on it. Especially helpful would be feedback on whether I forgot a specific topic, or if something is unnecessary and can be removed, or if the structure/organization of the contents can be improved.

For feedback (German or English are both okay) you can either submit an issue, a pull request, or send me an e-mail at alexander.w.engelhardt@gmail.com
