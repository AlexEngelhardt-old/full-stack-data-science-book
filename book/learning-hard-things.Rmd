# Learning Hard Things

- Become a self-learner / autodidact

## Problem Solving

- You'll be an all-rounder
- You'll encounter many many diverse problems. Expect to deal with much of that
- Polya's book "How to solve it"

## Singletask

- Learn **one** thing (language) very well. Learn the internals of the
  language. A generalist recognizes patterns and can generalize/extrapolate, and
  e.g. quickly understand how objects work in R if he knows how objects work in
  Python.
  - Try building a product end-to-end:

	- She built a bot that scrapes art, stores in AWS, and a AWS Lambda that
      tweets art

## Deep Work

  - It's often a complex system
  - Keep at it, the stubborn will win, not the smart or fast guys
  - If it seems too complex from a birds eye view, put on scheuklappen
	and learn one single thing, then another, then one more.
    - *Everyone else* did exactly that. No one was born knowing e.g. git.

## Making Mistakes

  - Example: The git workflow seems complex at the beginning
  - If you learn and use best practices right away, you'll know them,
	  but you won't love them
  - You'll only start noticing its value after you screw up a few times
  - So screw up a lot! Preferably in your private side projects, not at
	  work.
  - Lessons you have *learnt* instead of *read* will stick better, you'll
    intuitively understand *why* some additional effort is necessary and
    actually a good thing because it will ultimately pay off (as needing less
    time)
