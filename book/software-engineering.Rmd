# Software Engineering

- Become a good programmer!
- Read Clean Code and The Pragmatic Programmer
- Read standard library code to converge to their coding style
  - For Python: https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.8/Lib
- Do code challenges to get good at algorithms and general coding
  - start with codewars, then leetcode, hackerrank, topcoder
  - Advent of Code as an honorable mention
- Ask HN: What change in your programming technique has been most transformative?

	   - To learn
	     - Static typing in Python
	     - Continuous Delivery
	     - Programming Paradigms: Logic, Probabilistic, Testing
	     
- Python
  - Fluent Python, Luciano Ramalho
  - Then write your scripts as a Python package
     https://python-packaging-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_py.html
     - And `pip install -e ` in Development mode. This way, the package is only a link to the source, and no reinstalling is necessary!

## Tools

### The Linux command line

### Your Text Editor

### Version control

- Understand the concepts, not the commands
- This script is cool:

    - https://gist.github.com/radum/fd54f20e9ee5de1b6c4d1b18c15a9a00
- Also know of: Data Version control

## Programming Concepts

- Yes it's annoying to learn in the beginning and it's more work to set up
- But: So is building a concrete house vs. a straw hut.

### Documentation
 
### Literate Programming

### Reproducibility

- Virtualenv / venv, requirements.txt with *fixed* version numbers.
     - https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/923d9d/solution_for_syspathappend_pep8_import_issues/
     - Source:
       https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/
     - Solves these problems
       - You update package X from v1 to v2, suddenly a deprecated function you
         used is removed, thus your code breaks.
	 - So in this project, you need to stick with v1
	 - But in your other project B, you depend on a new function that was
           only added in v2
	   - In Python, you can't specify the version of a package you want to
             import
       - You want to install and import your own package, but not "globally"
     - One could argue that one does not need virtualenv for a production environment because there is no mixing on a deployed and self contained production (virtual) box. However, it will be useful for having identical environments between development and production, and virtualenv is very useful in a more dynamic development environment.

### Object-oriented Programming

### Testing
- pytest

#### Integration testing
- Smoke testing: Just see if your model API is available once it's published
  - pytest smoketests.py (?)
  
#### Data testing: `great_expectations`

- Or your own python package data_verificator (as dv)
     - Specify data schema to verify your recurring data set against
     - Solves problems:
       - Client sends you updated data set in the middle of the analysis
	 that breaks your code
       - Recurring data every week or so, and at some point the guys
	 change column denominations, factor levels etc. unknowingly
     - MyDataset_schema = {
           'timestamp': {
               'type': pd.Timestamp,
	       'nullable': False,
	       'min': '2019-01-01 00:00:00+00:00',
	       'max': '2100-01-01 00:00:00+00:00',
	   },
	   'the_angle':
               'type': float,
	       'nullable': True
	       'min': '0',
	       'max': '360',
            }
       }
