# Communication

## Speaking

- Know who to talk to
- How to communicate results
- Ich hab dazu mal gelesen: The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully, by Gerald M. Weinberg, aber nur 2/5 Sterne gegeben :)
    - Oder: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1044831.Are_Your_Lights_On_
    - (Problem solving in general. Auch das Buch von George (?) Polya) (maybe "Problem Solving" can become its own chapter)
- **Communication** depends on recipient: empathize
  - Talking to DSs, talk about your model and its parameters
  - Talking to executives, focus on their interests: business outcome, financial
    impact, what kind of actions you recommend.
  - Speak in a language they understand (multilingual :) )

## Writing

- writing project proposals
- documentation

## Requirements engineering

- Know what to build
- clearly define the goal (a business sucess metric
- e.g. When they want a Deep Learning monster, but a linear regression will do
- As simple as possible, as complex as necessary)

## Results

- We like to focus on tinkering with the model
- But keep your sight on the business goal. Get to the point where you can demonstrate that your hypothesis / call-to-action can result in an actual change in the business

## Hand-over

- Ideally, as a consultant, stay on for a month after deployment to monitor
  it. But! Make it easy to change, so the client can afterwards:
  - Maintain/adapt the model
  - Watching for **model drift**
- That's why you need an initial few days to watch the team, what tools they
  use, what tech they're familiar with, so you can pass it back to them
  afterwards.
- Document it well!
