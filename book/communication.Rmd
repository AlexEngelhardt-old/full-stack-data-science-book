# Communication

The soft skills arenâ€™t taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find!

## Speaking

- Know who to talk to
- How to communicate results
- Ich hab dazu mal gelesen: The Secrets of Consulting: A Guide to Giving and Getting Advice Successfully, by Gerald M. Weinberg, aber nur 2/5 Sterne gegeben :)
    - Oder: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1044831.Are_Your_Lights_On_
    - (Problem solving in general. Auch das Buch von George (?) Polya) (maybe "Problem Solving" can become its own chapter)
- **Communication** depends on recipient: empathize
  - Talking to DSs, talk about your model and its parameters
  - Talking to executives, focus on their interests: business outcome, financial
    impact, what kind of actions you recommend.
      - Non technical stakeholder communication skills: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships

  - Speak in a language they understand (multilingual :) )

- If you're really bad at speaking (like I was), I can recommend Toastmasters
  - Especially table topics help for small talk

## Business Understanding / Requirements Engineering

- Big thing: Mapping the domain experts' description of their problem to a ML problem description that you can solve
- The *one metric rule*: Define one metric to optimize and guide decisions.

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly.

- Know what to build
- clearly define the goal (a business sucess metric)
- e.g. When they want a Deep Learning monster, but a linear regression will do
- As simple as possible, as complex as necessary)

----

- How you will (or are able to) later deploy the model will already influence what you can and can't do in the modeling phase.
- The worst thing is if you spend 6 months to build a model the DevOps team then can't deploy.
- So use the business understanding phase, not only to define the objectives, but equally important: to **define the constraints** under which you'll have to work.
- Many projects die because the result can't be deployed. The worst thing is that this often only is realized at the very end, after much time was wasted.

## Results

- We like to focus on tinkering with the model
- But keep your sight on the business goal. Get to the point where you can demonstrate that your hypothesis / call-to-action can result in an actual change in the business
