# Infrastructure

- Start with building the right infrastructure, on-premise or cloud
- This is one of the greater challenges. If you're working on a greenfield project, to build the pipeline to get to the point where you can actually start doing DS
- Big challenges:
  - 80%: Get the data ready to do DS on it
    - won't change soon: Data is messy and different data sets don't align
    - But companies are pushing towards better **data governance**
  - Tool selection
  - Best practices: What are other companies in this industry doing?
  
## Cloud Services

- AWS, Azure, GCP
- Good way to train large models
- cloud makes many things easier, but new problems arise, e.g. data leaks (horror stories of accidentally public S3 containers)
- Nice way to get familiar with the concepts: I like doing a certificate as a clearly defined goal line to get familiar with what's possible

## Pipelines, APIs and Software Engineering

- At this stage, you'll also need skills that are valuable in the DevOps part (productionizing your model)
