# Best Practices

- Or, instead of "best practices", something like "related concepts" or "good to know" topics
- Or separate them and keep both of these


- There is no solidified best practices yet (like it is in frontend SW eng)
- re-read (and include a chapter on) **The elements of data analytic style**
- Facebook and Google released guides on ML (Google's is particularly good)
- Ethics
  - e.g. Data Leaks. Secure your data! Don't collect what you don't need!
  
## Interpretable Machine Learning / Explainable AI

- As a consultant, you hand over stuff a lot.
  - Prefer simpler models that are easily explainable and interpretable
- Ethical reasons (e.g. Gender Bias)
- Legal reasons (GDPR e.g.)

## Fairness / Bias

- Christoph Molnar

## Adversarial Attacks

although not a "best practice". Maybe this chapter should be called "other topics to be aware of"
