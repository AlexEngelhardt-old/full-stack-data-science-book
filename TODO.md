# Decisions

- [ ] Focus on Python? Or do both? Will be hard for presenting software (e.g. must write about Shiny and Dash)

# Expert Interviews

- To find book topics, get opinions about favorite tools, pipelines, practices
  etc., or even include entire interviews in the book as a section.

# Practice projects / Labs

- Encourage reader to code along with *his own* practice project. If he doesn't have one, provide one example project in the book and you code along using that one

- A real-time backtesting tool (or a stub for it, at least)
   - daily ingest Google Finance API
   - Write to your SQL
   - monthly training + store model
   - API for model access (some sort of prediction)
- Or: have all the practical exercises as a lab in the appendix
  - That can then become a separate repository, and even a YouTube course or a 3-day course (online or live)
