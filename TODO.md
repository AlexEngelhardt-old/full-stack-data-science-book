# Decisions

- [X] Focus on Python? Or do both? Will be hard for presenting software (e.g. must write about Shiny and Dash)

# Book Abstract

- This book is aimed at 
  - The data science graduate (university or MOOC) who has some experience in
    building prediction models and wants to choose the most fitting field to
    specialize in.
  - The expert in a particular field who wants to broaden his view and see how
    his skills fit into the bigger picture
  - The consultant who needs to become a generalist to quickly adapt to each new
    client's existing environment
  - The solo entrepreneur or startup founder who has no other choice than to
    build the entire data product himself
  - The IT executive who oversees the full pipeline from infrastructure to final
    data products and who needs a broad awareness of all topics across the data
    value chain to make informed decisions
- It teaches at least awareness of all topics around the classical ML you learn
  at uni or in a MOOC
- This book's goal is not to make you an expert in any of them, but to give you
  a birds-eye view of the whole landscape
- If you don't know that screwdrivers exist, you'll use your hammer to drive in
  a screw
- If you know these topics exist, you can choose the appropriate tool for the
  job (even if you'll first have to learn it)
- Also, knowing about e.g. the DevOps part, even if you won't use it in your
  job, you will know common pitfalls and problems and will build better products
  to hand over to the operations team (i.e. easier for them to put into
  production)

# Expert Interviews

- To find book topics, get opinions about favorite tools, pipelines, practices
  etc., or even include entire interviews in the book as a section.

# Case Studies

- Janek is working on a Fraunhofer paper on a case study / consulting project which he might be allowed to publish.

# Practice projects / Labs

- Encourage reader to code along with *his own* practice project. If he doesn't have one, provide one example project in the book and you code along using that one

- A real-time backtesting tool (or a stub for it, at least)
   - daily ingest Google Finance API
   - Write to your SQL
   - monthly training + store model
   - API for model access (some sort of prediction)
- Or: have all the practical exercises as a lab in the appendix
  - That can then become a separate repository, and even a YouTube course or a 3-day course (online or live)
